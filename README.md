## About ðŸ‘‹

With simplicity and elegance in mind, I design efficient, ergonomic and reliable systems. Pragmatic, to the point approach. Keep it clean and lean!

Passionate for code, with a strong focus on the business needs.

Mainly Java and Python but I frequently venture outside that perimeter. Groovy, Go, Swift, Scala, C... are fair game. Full stack when applicable. Devops too.
