## About ðŸ‘‹

With simplicity and elegance in mind, I design efficient, ergonomic and reliable systems. Pragmatic, to the point approach. Keep it clean and lean!

Passionate for code, with a strong focus on the business needs.

My primary tools are Python (FastAPI) and Java (SpringBoot) with Vue.js, but I frequently venture outside that perimeter. Go, Scala, C, Racket, Haskell are fair game. Familiar with AWS, GCP, Scaleway, Railway too.
